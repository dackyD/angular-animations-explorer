This project started as a demo for [In-Depth guide into Animations in Angular](https://indepth.dev/in-depth-guide-into-animations-in-angular) blogpost on **indepth.dev**, with the goal of providing a live version of all the techniques covered in the article that you could explore and play around with. 

Over time, the project grew beyond the article, showcasing even more animation techniques you can use in your Angular applications - including new features of Angular's animations module and other animation libraries.

It is broken down into different sections, each section covering a set of related techniques (i.e. Angular Animations, third-party library animations) along with a live demo that you can play with. Some of the demos have the same animation written in different ways. This is done intentionally to showcase how the different ways are reflected both visually on the UI and how the browser interprets the code.

> This is not meant to be as comprehensive or a replacement for [Angular's official documentation](https://angular.io/guide/animations), but rather a quick way to showcase the different animation methods that are available, look at their behavior, some use cases, and the code behind the implementation.

## Folder Structure

There are 2 main folders that contains the bulk of the content in the application.

- **Content**: All the content you see on the application are written in markdown located in [`src/assets/post-content/`](src/assets/post-content) in their respective folders.
- **Demo**: For posts that contains a demo component, these components are located in [`src/app/content/content-components`](src/app/content/content-components/).
